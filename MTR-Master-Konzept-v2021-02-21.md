MTR Master Project Concept

**Disciplinary background**

My disciplinary training is in mathematics. In the past few years I have become interested in a branch of mathematics called category theory. This is a type of mathematics which is very abstract, and through this abstraction it is also very general. I am attracted to it because I see it as:

-   a language for formalizing patterns and analogies across mathematics, the sciences, and engineering;
-   a tool for studying interconnection and composition of (abstract) structures;
-   an integrative framework which fosters conceptual clarity, principled design, interoperability, and bridging of domains. 

**Aims**

In the context of my master's project I am interested in processes which are dedicated to the exploration of the following inter-related groups of questions, which I will refer to as the “core questions”. In the following, "I" is not me, Jonathan, but a generic first-person. 

-   What are things that I want/wish/dream for? What am I (dis)satisfied with in life, on a personal, interpersonal, and societal level? 
-   What are the possibilities that I can imagine, for the near future or the present, of how “reality” could be different?
-   What factors condition and inform my relationship to these questions? 
-   What are processes by which I can shape my interaction with these questions? In particular, what kinds of processes are there beyond a self-reflective, discursive approach -- e.g. through actionable experiments and interpersonal interactions?
-   In which ways can constructive and collaborative first steps grow out of the above processes? 

  
**Exact formulation of the topic**

  

I am looking for a conceptual and linguistic vocabulary for my "field of content". 


One term is "applied utopia". This aims to combine the connotations of speculative, imaginative, optimistic, "utopian" thinking with the practicality of real-world application. As an oxymoron, it is meant to undermine the concept of utopia as an unreachable, far-away place, but instead suggest it as a frame of mind, an attitude, or a "substance" that can be used to approach problems in the here-and-now. 


Another term is that of "protopia". In place of "utopia" as a "perfect" place, beyond the horizon, a protopia is a world which is only slightly better than the current one, in some way or another. It is not about masterplans and end-goals, but about incremental changes to the status quo. It is about possible directions to move in. For me, it describes a continual process rather than a static vision. It is about "prototyping for a better world". 

  

I wish to also emphasize: 

1.  A pluralistic conception of protopian processes - one that acknowledges and embraces a multiplicity of parallel and inter-related protopias, forming an ecosystem of ever-branching, conflicting or recombining processes. 
2.  The element of interpersonal/collective dialogue, exchange, co-creation, conflict/contrast as a fruiful mode for exploration, inspiration, negotiation, and clarification of protopias. 

  

  

_What interests me about the topic?_

  

I would like -- for my own life and that of the people around me -- to learn/invent/practice techniques for dealing with the "core questions" above in imaginative, playful, and co-constructive ways. I am curious what happens when I understand better how people around me think, feel, and interact with these questions, and when there is a shared practice of explicitly engaging with them from different angles. The artistic and aesthetic dimensions of this project interest me as well - I see these as connected especially to the gestures of widening the space of possibilities and incorporating non-discursive modes of exploration and reflection.

  

The processes that happen in the context of my project will hopefully be enriching for those who participate, and perhaps provide inspiration for other similar endeavors. The (presumptuous!) "protopian premise" is that this topic is something the world "needs": that it is something that can be fun, personally meaningful, useful, and possibly open small doorways towards "better worlds". The logic is this: getting more/better/differently in touch with ourselves and with other people, in combination with practicing imagination, is fertile ground for living differently and "well". 

  

  

**Research question and choice of method**

  

I am interested in experimenting with formats which explore the core questions listed in section a). Specifically, I wish to experiment with: 

  

1.  Workshop formats, where a group of people is in dialogue and interaction with each other and with the above-stated core questions. 
2.  The development of a pattern language for such workshops, and for the topic of "protopian processes" in general. 

  

_Workshops_

  

Here I imagine doing sessions with small groups of people, over the course of a few hours at a time, say. The general idea is that of an exploration and a dialogue of sharing thoughts and feelings; not a "problem-solving" process (that could potentially come later as a different type of format). With such workshops I hope to explore approaches to applied utopia that are playful, meaningful, and integrate various modes of experience. That is, in additional to language-based forms of communication, I wish to consciously emphasize other dimensions, such as corporal, musical, aesthetic-emotional, symbolic, theatrical, and meditative practices. In abstract terms, I think of such a session in terms of a participatory composition/choreography/performance-ritual.

  

_Pattern Language_

  

In this part of my project, I would like to start building a "pattern language for protopian processes". Pattern languages are a design methodology and tool based on creating, for a given topic/domain, a sort of "periodic table" or "toolbox", the components of which are "patterns". Each pattern contains, at a certain level of abstraction, the formulation of a reoccurring design problem, along with proposals for solutions to it. More generally, they can be thought of as encodings of "archetypical" or "atomic" situations. The patterns in the language are also interlinked among themselves to indicate relationships, possible combinations, etc. I will initiate a pattern language for protopian processes based on my experiences in the "workshop part" of my project and in collaboration with others. The idea is that it is a dynamic entity which can grow and change over time. Specifically, I will:

1.  Implement a way of writing/reading the pattern language online in a wiki-webpage
2.  Explore ways to transfer the pattern language from digital space to the analogue, physical world. In particular, I imagine making cards out of the patterns, so they can be used as physical artifacts e.g. in my workshops. 
3.  Reflect on the process of making such a language, and potentially develop tools for people to make their own languages. I would also like to explore the possibilities for various pattern languages to co-exist, merge, diverge, and interact. 

  

**Formulation of the transdisciplinary constellation**

  

The "core questions" that are the starting point of my topic are arguably transdisciplinary and/or non-disciplinary. And my intended approach to the topic is transdisciplinary, in that it occupies a space connecting various discipinary practices. Specifically, my project incorporates elements that I would associate with the disciplinary contexts of mathematics, design, art, psychology, and social work. 

  

I see my disciplinary background in mathematics as closely related to the pattern language component of my project. For example, in the topics of pattern(ning), abstraction, systemic thinking, coordinatizing, and glyphing. This component of the project is also about design, in that it draws on the pattern language design methodologies and philosophy, and will be a concrete artifact to be designed with users in mind.

  

On the other hand, I see the workshop aspect of my project as relating to psychological, social and artistic practices. The social and psychological dimensions are evident in my project's intention to instigate socially-oriented group processes for engaging with protopia. I see an artistic dimension present in both the use of aesthetically-informed non-discursive approaches, as well as in the central role of imagination and creative speculation, which I view as a fundamentally artistic activity. 

  

  

**Form and media choice**

  

Workshops: I hope to hold these in physical spaces. Groups sizes ca. 2 - 15 people. 

Ideally I will be able to "inhabit" a space and use it as an installation space for a few days or weeks at a time. Longer term, a space of my own is desired. This will allow to better incorporate, in the workshop design, the intentional creation of the aesthetics and organization of the space. 

Pattern Language: Here I imagine, on the one hand, a digital wiki-style website which contains the pattern language prototype and can be collaboratively edited. On the other hand, I plan to develop a physical deck of cards, based on the pattern language. The cards can be a tool for thinking/designing in terms of the pattern language, as well as being artifacts that can play a performative role in workshops/happenings. 

  

Master Project Text: This will mainly consist of a digital hypertext (wiki-style), which is designed to also be converted into a printed booklet. In this text, I will attempt to approach the topic of protopian processes in a kaleidoscope manner. This means: sketching some theory of what "protopian processes" can mean; making connections to some existing ideas and works; collecting thoughts on miscellaneous aspects of the topic; including semi-poetic text fragments and possibly images.
