# Thoughts + Ideas
- [[Katherine]] mentioned that in a reading group she participated in they incorporated in each session one non-discursive/textual element... e.g. sharing music. 
	- I think it could be nice to include something like this in the sessions... e.g. have someone share one thing each time.. perhaps it could be an architectural image... or any image... 
	- I think it would also be nice to do a small personal check in round each time, to tune in together
- [[Katherine]] was mentioning also that she like if there isn't an expert type of person, so that the learning is more open and the synergies of the group can happen





# Organizational planning
- Advertise
	- Make a short, simple webpage, attached to lorand.earth ?
	- Spell out intended syllabus briefly
	- Email a few people to invite them to participate
		- People to also ask:
			- [[Simon Whittle]]!
			- Greek architect people and friends...? 
			- Yael 
			- 
	- Be careful not to be too many people? Or is there a way to deal with a situation where we could be many? Split into groups?
- Do a doodle to find a bi-weekly meeting time that fits for all?
	- Evenings or weekends probably best, to accomodate working people
- Tentative participants list
	- Katherine MacBride
	- Eduardo Ivanec
	- Simon Whittle ? & Dana ? 
	- Yael ? 
	- Ivo ? 
	- ZHdK people (5?)
	- Rene Baur? 
	- Catherine Viguera? + Alexandra? 
	- Other architect friends ? 
	- Protopia friends?

- Using Hypothesis
	- Seems that default for annotations is that they are "private to me"
		- would be good if there is a way to change this default
	- i should alert/instruct participants to adjust this so that we can see people annotations! and do this before people start, so that this doesn't have to be changed post haste for every annotation!
	- in the "group setting", it seems that highlight without any written notes with them do not show up ? but in the "public setting" they do?
		- https://web.hypothes.is/help/why-are-highlights-private-by-default/
			- "Weâ€™ve chosen to keep highlights private to avoid pages being cluttered by highlights that have no surrounding discussion. We understand that people may want to share highlights with others, and we think there are effective ways we can address that in the future."
	- it appears that it is not in an obvious way possible to make annotations that are public, but then can be queried/selected for being done by only a certain group of users. 
	- Is it even possibly to see all public annotations in context from a specified user? 
		- one possible workaround seems to be to use the search function and search for the user name
		- but here still all highlights from the whole group in the doc are shown
			- but: when hovering over a note, that note is changed from yellow highlighting to a blue-ish hightlighting, so one knows where to look
			- if many people highlight, an issue is that one might want to turn off all the highlighting except for the notes from a specified single user
	- when I refresh in "group setting", my own notes get a "locked symbol" added to them
		- the notes that get locked are the ones that are only highlighting, with no annoted text-note
	- in the following screen shot, i don't understand what the little tabs are, with the numbers "1" and "2" and "1" on them (one of the ones with "1" is pointing upwards). In total there are four annotations here; one of them is with a lock on it.
