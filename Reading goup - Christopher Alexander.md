- Thoughts + Ideas
	- [[Katherine]] mentioned that in a reading group she participated in they incorporated in each session one non-discursive/textual element... e.g. sharing music. 
		- I think it could be nice to include something like this in the sessions... e.g. have someone share one thing each time.. perhaps it could be an architectural image... or any image... 
		- I think it would also be nice to do a small personal check in round each time, to tune in together
	- [[Katherine]] was mentioning also that she like if there isn't an expert type of person, so that the learning is more open and the synergies of the group can happen





- Organizational planning
	- Advertise
		- Make a short, simple webpage, attached to lorand.earth ?
		- Email a few people to invite them to participate
			- People to also ask:
				- [[Simon Whittle]]!
				- Greek architect people and friends...? 
				- Yael 
				- 
		- Be careful not to be too many people? Or is there a way to deal with a situation where we could be many? Split into groups?
	- Do a doodle to find a bi-weekly meeting time that fits for all?
		- Evenings or weekends probably best, to accomodate working people
		- 
		

- To-Dos
	- Write Irene to ask about getting a group Miro board?
