- Suggested program:
	- Step 1: Read the the paper [[A mathematical theory of co-design]],  freely available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08055)
		- This has no category theory in it, and should be understandable without any prerequisites. I think that having a quick look at this paper will give you a sense if doing this mini-curriculum is something that would interest you. Another option is to skip this paper, and just do Step 2 (the 4th chapter in Step 2 covers some of the material from Step 1, but using category theory).  
	- Step 2: Read the first four chapters in the book [[Seven Sketches in Compositionality]], freely available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316)
