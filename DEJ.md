		- Daniel's (short-) story:
			- an overall theme to place here at the start: the back and forth interplay between technology and society
			- a short choronology
				- began studying mulimedia engineering, was attracted to playing with tech
				- first study program was a mix of computer science and design, but felt like a frankenstein program
				- he moved to a design university to continue his study path
					- electronic art and digital design
				- got involved in touch-pad table project
				- this lead to being part of starting an UX design studio
				- in context of various projects became more interested the way people were interacting with digital projects/objects rather than on the content of those projects/objects
				- moved more into art
				- art was inspiring him and wanted to also inspire others 
				- developed his own form of artistic practice
				- stopped working for brands
				- moved to the woods with a friend (call them X); X has more tech skill than D
				- together they started prototyping 
					- D more on the research part
					- X on the tech part
				- D did a bootcamp to learn more of the tech tools
				- bounced back though to thinking more about the tools / human / interaction (??) side
				- trying to find balance
				
				
		- D: comment about how
			- artists "can do whatever they want"
				- society "accepts" this
				- D wants to have this freedom; doens't want to be an artist as a "job" or "unique role"
			- use of artistic techniques / practices as a medium
				- doing experiments
					- is "playting", but in the adult context
				- exploring  and sharing without restrictions
				- social space of creation
			- E: association with "carneval"
				- Art as a bargain 
				- being "decoupled" from society ? 
			- E: wants [[revolution]], not carneval
		- D: if he had to use a label (which he doesn't like), it would be that he works with "concepts" ("conceptual artist")
		- using art as a lens, a way of seeing


		- D: many people are asking similar questions to the ones we are asking/discussing
			- how to have these [[conversations]] with groups of people? 
		- E: how to also enable new connection making ? 
			- and how can groups have conversations among themselves (between groups)
				- [[liquid democracy]], delegates ?
		- E: info com 
			- [[text adventures]] / [[interactive fiction]]
			- [[collaborative writing]]
			- [[conversation trees]]
		- E: interested in the spectrum between writing with natural languages and programming
		- D: broad current interest: information and the digital context
			- what are structurings of information that make it useful to me and others? 
		- E: "[[Context]]" is a key concept
			- key problem in CS and [[information theory]]: the question of "state"
			- a way to think of context: 
				- an intersection of [[world model]]s (e.g. between communicating parties), together with
				- [[transformations]] (i.e. ones we do in our minds), such as
					- when translating terms in one's mind when someone else is speaking
					- tracing paths of thinking (??)
					- knowing who one is speaking/listening to and interpreting in this context
			- some things are able to be externalized as technical tools
				- if they are modularizable and can have an "interface" to interact and link up with
			- some things are somehow so entangled and enmeshed that it seems impossible to seperate them out from what happens in the mind and externalize them
