A term I found [here](https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/wooda/omnitopia/omnitopia.html), in relation to urban studies
"Â What is it?
	 _Omnitopia_ enacts a structural and perceptual enclave whose apparently distinct locales convey inhabitants to a singular place.
 Huh?
 	Think of it this way: When you can flow from place to place, experiencing it all as one vast interior, cocooned in your own bubble, interacting with other people and natural parts of the world only as a series of objects, you're in omnitopia."
