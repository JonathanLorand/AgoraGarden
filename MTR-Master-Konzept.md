# Draft of Master Concept 
At the end of the first semester, students enter the draft of a written master project proposal that re- flects the current status of their considerations. This proposal includes:

# a)  Starting position and goal (max. 1⁄4 page). 
What is my background? What interests me? Which topic do I work on?
	
My background. 	
	
My disciplinary training is in mathematics. In the past few years I have become interested in a branch of mathematics called category theory. This is a type of mathematics which is very abstract, and through this abstraction it is also very general. It is a language for formalizing patterns and analogies across all of mathematics. A mathematics of mathematics, one might say. 

Category theory is also used to identify and describe abstract patterns in domains outside of mathematics. Historically, this has been mostly in computer science and physics. Increasingly category theory is also applied in other domains, such as engineering and life sciences. Currently there is a new wave of interest and research activity in "applied category theory". I am drawn to this topic because of its usefullness for understanding analogies between domains, and for studying interconnection and composition of structures. It is an integrative framework which can serve as a tool for conceptual clarity, principled design, and interoperability. 

What interests me? What topic do I work on? 

In the context of my master's project I am interested in processes which are dedicated to the exploration of the following three inter-related groups of questions, which I will refer to as the *core questions*. In the following, "I" is not me, Jonathan, but a generic first-person. 
1. What are things that I want/wish/dream for? What am I (dis)satisfied with in life, on a personal, interpersonal, and societal level? 
2. What are the possibilities that I can imagine, for the near future or the present, of how things could be different?
3. What factors condition and inform my relationship to these questions? What are processes by which I can shape my interaction with these questions? In particular, what kinds of processes are there beyond a self-reflective, discursive approach -- e.g. through actionable experiments and interpersonal interactions?




# b)  Exact formulation of the topic (max. 1page). 
What is the field of content in which I move? What interests me about the topic? Is there already knowledge that I fall back on? Are there reference projects / objects to which I refer?


What is the field of content in which I move? 

This question is a part of my project's process. I am looking for a conceptual and linguistic vocabulary for my "field of content". 

One term is "applied utopia". This aims to combine the connotations of speculative, imaginative, optimistic, "utopian" thinking with the practicality of real-world application. As an oxymoron, it is meant to undermine the concept of utopia as an unreachable, far-away place, but instead suggest it as a frame of mind, an attitude, or a "substance" that can be used to approach problems in the here-and-now. 

Another term is that of "protopia". In place of "utopia" as a "perfect" place beyond the horizon, a protopia is a world which is only slightly better than the current one, in some way or another. It is not about masterplans and end-goals, but about incremental changes to the status quo. It is about possible directions to move in. For me, it describes a continual process rather than a static vision. It is about "prototyping for a better world". 

%The above two terms, respectively, aim to link the creative dreaming of %utopiansim with practical daily life, and shift from static visions to %incremental processes. 

I wish to also emphasize: 

1. A pluralistic conception of protopian processes - one that acknowledges and embraces a multiplicity of parallel and inter-related protopias, forming an ecosystem of ever-branching, conflicting or recombining processes. 
2. The element of interpersonal/collective dialogue, exchange, co-creation, conflict/contrast as a fruiful mode for exploration, inspiration, negotiation, and clarification of protopias. 


*What interests me about the topic?*

I would like -- for my own life and that of the people around me -- to learn/invent/practice techniques for dealing with the "core questions" above in imaginative, playful, and co-constructive ways. I am curious what happens when I understand better how people around me think, feel, and interact with these questions, and when there is a shared practice of explicitly engaging with them from different angles. 

I imagine/hope that the processes that happen in the context of my project will be enriching for others who participate, and perhaps provide inspiration for other similar endeavors. The (presumptious!) "protopian premise" is that this topic (protopian processes) is something the world "needs": that it is something that can be fun, useful, and possibly open small doorways towards "better worlds". The logic is this: getting more/better/differently in touch with ourselves and with other people, in combination with practicing imagination, is fertile ground for living differently and "well".

# c) Research question and choice of method (max. 1 page)
What question(s) do I put in my Master Project and how do I try to answer it? Which methods do I use and why did I choose them? 

I am interested in experimenting with formats which explore the core questions listed in section a). Specifically, I wish to experiment with: 
- Workshop formats, where a group of people is in dialogue and interaction with each other and with the above-stated core questions. 
- The development of a pattern language for such workshops, and for the topic of "protopian processes" in general. 

Workshops

Here I imagine doing sessions with small groups of people, over the course of a few hours at a time, say. The general idea is that of an exploration and a dialogue of sharing thoughts and feelings; not a "problem-solving" process (that could protentially come later as a different type of format). With such workshops I hope to explore approaches to applied utopia that are playful, meaningful, and integrate various modes of experience. That is, in additional to language-based forms of communication, I wish to consciously emphasize other dimensions, such as corporal, musical, aesthetic-emotional, symbolic, theatrical, and meditative practices. In abstract terms, I think of such a session in terms of a participatory composition/choreography/performance-ritual. A reference point here is e.g. the deep listening sessions of [REF]
