		My disciplinary training is in mathemathics. 

# b)  Exact formulation of the topic (max. 1page). 
	What is the field of content in which I move? What interests me about the topic? Is there already knowledge that I fall back on? Are there reference projects / objects to which I refer?

# c) Research question and choice of method (max. 1 page)
	What question(s) do I put in my Master Project and how do I try to answer it? Which methods do I use and why did I choose them? 
	
# d) Formulation of the transdisciplinary constellation (max. 1 page).
