### Structure

My text will be a two-layered hypertext.

By 'hypertext', I mean that the text will be divided into modular pieces (I'll call them chapters) which need not be read in a fixed linear order. Furthermore, each of the chapters will contain hyperlinks (analogous to the ones we know from the internet) to other chapters.

By 'two-layered', I mean that each chapter will have two types of text: besides the fuller 'body' of text of the chapter, there will also be a short 'header' text written in a compact manner which aims to summarize the essence of that chapter. In this manner, a reader who wishes to capture the gist of the full text in a short amount of time may read only the header texts of all the chapters. This idea is inspired by the structure of [Ref: literary machines] and [Ref: timeless way of building].  

### Medium

The text will be written digitally, and also a physical printing will be made.
In the digital version, the hyperlinks will be working links; in the physical version, the hyperlinks will be indicated syntactically.
